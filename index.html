            <p>Hello, I am Alyssa Rowe!

                I am a freelance UX/UI designer.

                I have a background in Gym Management and Personal Training. I have experience in working with
                various personalities, as well as putting myself in my clientâ€™s shoes to better understand their
                goals and why that is their goal. Aesthetics is always part of their goal as well. My goal is to
                create user friendly and aesthetically pleasing User Interfaces.
